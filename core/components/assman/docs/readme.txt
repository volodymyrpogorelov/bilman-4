=============

Asset Manager Media Library for MODX Revolution including automatic MIME-type detection.

This package adds asset management functionality to MODX Revolution so you can easily upload and edit images and other assets and attach them to any MODX page.  Because it stores all asset data in a custom database table, you can easily search for assets by complex criteria or manipulate the search queries for custom reporting.

The end result of using the Asset Manager can be similar to adding multiple image Template Variables to a template (e.g. using MIGX), but the user interface and backend data model is cleaner.

See https://github.com/craftsmancoding/assetmanager for more information.
